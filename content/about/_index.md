title: "`bigo` snippets of wisdom"
---

My name is Matheus and everyone calls me `bigo`. I've been dedicating my life to building software for the past 16+ years and decided to blog about it so that you can learn from my scars.

I've worked in a tech giant, failing/sucessful startups and open source. I've lead tiny and big teams. I've run `DELETE FROM users; WHERE ID = '123';` in production (long time ago, thankfully) but also built a search business from scratch.

This website is me fulfilling my dream of blogging from github.
